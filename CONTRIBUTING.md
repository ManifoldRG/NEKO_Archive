Welcome to the Manifold contributing guide, and thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

In this guide, you will get an overview of the contribution workflow for the community.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the README. We also have project-related documentation available at [Manifold Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15_dqh_2x_3g4A-uujflet6Oa6o9G4Oo1?usp=sharing).

## Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See [Issues](https://github.com/ManifoldRG/NEKO/issues) for more information. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to look into it and engage in discourse in the comments on the issue.

### Contributing to the Codebase

After identifying an issue you want to work on, follow the standard open source contribution model: Fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes, and then submit a pull request (PR).

We encourage you to submit your contributions through PRs. When submitting a PR, please provide a clear description of the changes you've made and reference the issue number you're addressing. Your PR will be reviewed by the maintainers and they may ask for changes or provide feedback before merging it into the project. Please note that quality code reviews take time and not all proposed changes can be incorporated.

For major changes, it is always a good idea to open a discussion first to make sure your proposed changes align with the project's direction.

You can also speak with us about contributions, or about anything else, in the Discord server. We are an active community and would love to discuss Manifold projects, hear about what you've been working on, and generally discuss ML and AI related topics with you! Join [here](https://discord.gg/a8uDbxzEbM).

As a final note, please be respectful when commenting on these issues as they are publicly viewable. Thank you!
